# Machine-Learning-with-Python-Decision-Trees
In this lab exercise, you will learn a popular machine learning algorithm, Decision Tree. You will use this classification algorithm to build a model from historical data of patients, and their response to different medications. Then you use the trained decision tree to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.
